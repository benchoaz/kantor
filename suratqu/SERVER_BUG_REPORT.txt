REPORT: SERVER-SIDE CRITICAL BUG
DATE: 2026-01-04
SEVERITY: CRITICAL (Blocker)

ISSUE SUMMARY:
Users cannot authenticate via `api/v1/auth/token`. The server returns a 200 OK status but the body contains a PHP Fatal Error, causing the JSON parsing on the client to fail.

ERROR MESSAGE:
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class "Request" not found in /home/sidiksae/public_html/api/app/Controllers/AuthController.php:109

LOCATION:
File: /home/sidiksae/public_html/api/app/Controllers/AuthController.php
Line: 109

DIAGNOSIS:
The `AuthController` class is trying to use a `Request` class (likely for type hinting or dependency injection) but the class has not been imported or fully qualified.

LIKELY CAUSE:
Missing `use` statement at the top of the file.

SUGGESTED FIX (For API Developer):

1. Open `/home/sidiksae/public_html/api/app/Controllers/AuthController.php`
2. Add the correct namespace import at the top. 

Example (if using standard CodeIgniter/Laravel/Generic style):
```php
use App\Core\Request; // OR
use App\Http\Request;
```

OR check line 109 and remove the type hint if it's unnecessary:
```php
// BEFORE
public function login(Request $request) { ... }

// AFTER (Quick Fix)
public function login($request) { ... }
```
